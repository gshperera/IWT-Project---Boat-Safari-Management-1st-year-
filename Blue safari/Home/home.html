            Boat riding is a very enjoyable activity to do when you are in Sri Lanka. It gives you an insight to the life of the people living along the river bank and also a chance to see the unique growth of plantation and the bio diversity integrated around the river region. You might be lucky enough to see Birds living around the river and in some rivers there will be water monitors. Some rivers are where people practice fishing for their living. So there are possibilities that you will be able to learn one or two fishing techniques from a native fisherman. Apart from that the rare opportunity to watch the mind-blowing view of the sinking sun from a lagoon will be possible if you take the chance to go on a boat ride.The most famous locations for a boat ride include Madu River in Balapitiya, Gal oya-which is the only wildlife national sanctuary which offers an opportunity to travel through boat and of course last but not least Muthurajawela.

        <p>The safaris start at the last section of the broad River Bentota (The Bentota lagoon), and cruises inland. The Bentota lagoon scattered with small islands and natural landscape provides tangled mangrove swamps. The boat men will meander through the islets and mangrove swamps located haphazardly on the river. Your sight will be mysterious and beautiful at once, as you cruise through shaded waters beneath huge roots. The longer you need to explore, the further upriver you want to cruise, the more unspoilt the scenery becomes. Aquatic birds-herons, cormorants & colourful kingfishers and water monitors & crocodiles can be seen during your safari.
        Most cruise trips are for three hours while the Dinner Cruise lasts for 5 hours. It will be a fun experience - a combination of thrills and wild water that is sure to be a highlight of your Sri Lankan holiday.</p>
